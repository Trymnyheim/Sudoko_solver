# Sudoku Solver

## About  
An interactive interface for solving Sudoku puzzles using a brute-force algorithm. The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, where the `SudokuSolver` class serves as the controller, coordinating interactions between the GUI and the `Sudoku` model.

## Usage

With a blank board:
```
java Main
```

Loading board from a text-file (see /test_files for examples):
```
java Main <file name> <size>
```

## Motivation
Written while taking the course, Object-Oriented Programming, at UiO, as a fun way to dive deeper into the subjects of the course.
